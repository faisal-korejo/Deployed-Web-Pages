This project includes a simple web page, which consists of the following components:

1. index.html: 

This file is the main structure of the webpage. It contains the HTML markup, which is the skeleton of the page, including elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It serves as the entry point to the web page.

2. style.css: 

This file contains the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) rules to style the HTML elements. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the webpage, ensuring that it is visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. Dockerfile: 

This is a script used to build a Docker container for deploying the web page. The Dockerfile defines the environment needed for the webpage to run, such as installing the necessary web server and copying the HTML and CSS files into the container. By using this Dockerfile, you can easily package the web page into a Docker container and deploy it consistently across different environments.
